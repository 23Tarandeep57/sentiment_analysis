# Sentiment Analysis with Attention Mechanism ðŸ§ 

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using an **attention mechanism from scratch**. The goal is to classify text inputs (like reviews or tweets) into **positive or negative sentiments**, with a focus on understanding the internal mechanics rather than relying on high-level ML libraries.

# Dataset

Yelp review dataset is used

- `sentiment_analysis_attention.ipynb`: Complete implementation of the attention-based sentiment classification model with code, math, and visualizations.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization.
- Building word embeddings from scratch.
- Implementing a custom attention mechanism to highlight important tokens.
- Sentiment classification using core Python and NumPy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Pandas** for handling text data
- **Matplotlib** for plotting and attention visualization

> No scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch used. 100% from scratch.
